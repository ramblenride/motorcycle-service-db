# Motorcycle Service DB Contribution Guide

This project is always looking for new contributors to create new templates or to correct or improve existing ones. Don't be afraid to jump in and help!

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

If you have found an issue with an existing template or have an idea for a new feature, please submit it to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ramblenride/motorcycle-service-db/issues) on Github.

Please try to put as much detail as possible in the bug report.

## Contributing

The recommended way for new contributors to submit new templates or fixes is to fork the repository on GitHub and then submit a pull request after committing the changes. The pull request will then need to be approved by one of the core developers before it is merged into the main repository.

You can also attach the updated file(s) to a bug report, or as a last resort, you can send us the files by email to <ramblenride+motodb@gmail.com>.

## Creating / Editing Templates

The templates are stored in simple JSON files that can be edited with any text editor. However, this can be tedious so it is recommended to use the [Braap!](https://ramblenride.github.io/braap/viewer/) web editor.

Before submitting the files, please add the file to the `src` directory and execute the project build script (`npm run build`) to format the file correctly and validate there is no error.
