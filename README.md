> A database of motorcycle service schedules

A simple collection of JSON files describing the service information for various motorcycles. The file format is described in [moto-service.schema.json](moto-service.schema.json).

A JSON file that contains all the entries can be generated using Node.js:

```shell
> npm install
> npm run build
```

The generated file is compliant with the specification in [moto-service.schema.json](moto-service.schema.json). An index file is also generated.

The output files are created in the ```dist``` directory.
